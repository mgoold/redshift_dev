--/* tree node analysis*/

--Each node in the tree can be one of three types#
	--& "Leaf": if the node is a leaf node
	--& "Root": if the node is the root of the tree
	--& "Inner": If the node is neither a leaf node nor a root node.
	
--Write an SQL query to report the type of each node in the tree. Return the result table in any order.
--id is the primary key column for this table.
--Each row of this table contains information about the id of a node and the id of its parent node in a tree.â€¨
--The given structure is always a valid tree. 

--if a row has no parent, it is a root
--if a row has a parent and no children, it is a child
--else it is an inner node
